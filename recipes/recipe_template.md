# {{PROBLEM}} Method Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem

Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have.

## 2. Design the Method Signature

Include the name of the method, its parameters, return value, and side effects.

```ruby

# The method doesn't print anything or have any other side-effects

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

Make a list of examples of what the method will take and return.

```ruby



```

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour.
